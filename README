Instructions on how to use our game's executable:
	- The executable can be found inside of finalproject-final-panda/Game
		- It is named "TofuWarrior.x86_64"
	- The executable MUST be in the same directory as the text file "roundInfo.txt"
		- That is the text file from which the game parses data to load in the rounds
		- That text file can be modified, as long as it still obeys the rules laid out in "PandaFinalReport.pdf"
			- If it doesn't, the game could do some very strange things (or crash)
		- If the executable is not in the same directory as "roundInfo.txt" single player mode won't work!

Instructions on how to build our game:
	- You will need the SCons build system installed on your machine
		- SCons can be downloaded here: https://scons.org/pages/download.html
	- Navigate to the "Source" folder
	- (Optional) If the Godot bindings haven't been generated for your system:
		- Navigate to the "godot-cpp" folder
		- Run scons "platform=[your platform] generate_bindings=yes" (osx for Mac, x11 for Linux)
			- If your OS is Linux or Windows include the flag "bits=64"
	- Run "scons platform=[your platform]" in the "finalproject-final-panda" folder
		- This will compile our game
	- Once compiled, open the project in Godot
		- Click on scan
		- Navigate to the "finalproject-final-panda" folder
		- Select this folder
	- Then play the main scene
